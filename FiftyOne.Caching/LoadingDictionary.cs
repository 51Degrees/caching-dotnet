    /// Implementation of <see cref="ILoadingDictionary{TKey, TValue}"/>.

    /// interface description.
    /// As per the source (https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/Collections/Concurrent/ConcurrentDictionary.cs,2f8bcdfbad10304f)
    /// <see cref="ConcurrentDictionary{TKey, TValue}.GetOrAdd(TKey, Func{TKey, TValue})"/>
    /// is not guaranteed to only call the factory once. Hence, we wrap the
    /// Tasks in a <see cref="Lazy{T}"/>, meaning the value doesn't get
    /// evaluated until it is read.
    /// It is the responsibility of the loader to handle cancellation of
    /// its Task when instructed to by the token. If a thread is left in
    /// an unresponsive state, it will result in failed gets for that key
    /// until the Task responds and can be removed from the dictionary.
    /// 
    /// Details of the use of <see cref="Lazy"/>:
    /// Consider the scenario where two get requests are made at the same
    /// instant, with the same key. Inside the
    /// <see cref="ConcurrentDictionary{TKey, TValue}.GetOrAdd(TKey, Func{TKey, TValue})"/>
    /// method, it will first call TryGet. Both will fail to get, as the key
    /// is not yet present. Both threads will then call ConcurrentDictionary.TryAddInternal(key, factory(key), ...).
    /// Only one will succeed in adding, and that result will be returned to
    /// both threads. However, both threads will have called the factory with
    /// the same key. If the factory directly starts a Task, it will run twice.
    /// If we instead wrap the Task in a Lazy, the actual Task will not be
    /// initialized until it is accessed. We know that a single result is
    /// returned to both threads, so only one Lazy will be resolved, the other
    /// will be lost and the Task never started.
    ///

    /// an expensive operation.
